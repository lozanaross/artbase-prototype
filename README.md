# Artbase Prototype 
This is a repository hosting work-in-progress designs for Rhizome's ArtBase redesign project. It is part of the PhD research work of Lozana Rossenova, working in collaboraiton with Rhizome's digital preservation team.

The current prototype is only to be used for user research purposes, it does not represent production-ready design.
