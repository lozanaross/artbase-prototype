# Artbase Prototype 
This is a repository hosting work-in-progress designs for Rhizome's ArtBase redesign project. It is part of the PhD research work of Lozana Rossenova, working in collaboration with Rhizome's digital preservation team.

The current prototype is meant to be used for user research purposes, it does not represent production-ready design.

## Prototype as expression of ideas
Please keep in mind this prototype is an expression of proposed ideas for information architecture and interaction in the archive, it is not a fully branded visual experience. 

It is also not connected to the ArtBase database, and therefore presents only a small sample of example pages from the archive. The primary focus of the prototype is the page template for an artwork and the presentation of variants related to the artwork. Many other pages in the prototype are labelled as “out-of-scope” and some links may lead you to the out-of-scope page. However, there are examples for most data types in the archive. If you are hitting the “out-of-scope” page often and are wondering what is *in the scope* of the prototype, please refer to the directory listing on this page.

## Access
The prototype hasn’t been tested extensively, but generally works as expected in contemporary Chrome and Firefox browsers on Mac, PC or Linux. It is responsive by default, but browsing on bigger screens is recommended for a better user experience. 

## Feedback survey
If you have a chance to browse the prototype and would like to give your feedback, please consider submitting your responses to this survey link: https://forms.gle/xiJZr9TqNx7Qwaar8

Responses are collected for research purposes only and will be anonymised when used for data analysis. Respondents will be contacted before any parts of their responses are used verbatim in any research communication materials.
